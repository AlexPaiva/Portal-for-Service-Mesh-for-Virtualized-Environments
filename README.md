# Portal-for-Service-Mesh-for-Virtualized-Environments

PECI Project 2023

A Portal designed to be offered as a helping solution for clients that can benefit from the user of Kubernetes into their application. The portal gives easy access to tasks that would otherwise need extensive knowledge of Kubernetes to be able to run properly. Layered access for multiple levels of knowledge.

Notes:
A Folder containing the website, another Folder containg the local vagrant basic deployment (manipulated later via Python and using the power of SSH).
